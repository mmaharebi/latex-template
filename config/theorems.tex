% SIMPLE ENVIRONMENTS (for backward compatibility with amsthm syntax)

% These use the standard amsthm syntax: \begin{exampleplain}[Optional Title]
% Restore simple theorem environments for those that don't need fancy boxes
\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{exampleplain}{Example}[section]
\newtheorem{remarkplain}[exampleplain]{Remark}
\newtheorem{definitionplain}[exampleplain]{Definition}

% Make standard environments use the plain versions by default for backward compatibility
% Users can use the tcolorbox versions by explicitly calling them with {title}{label}
